# Development history

Phase-by-phase build log, moved here from the README. The plan and research behind it live
in [`brainstorm.md`](../brainstorm.md) (Part A = plan, Part B = research).

## Phase log

**Phases 0–2 + A5 implemented.** Phase 0/A5: the seven "improvements over the literal
spec" from `brainstorm.md` §A5 (table below). Phase 1: `/harness-init` — intake interview
(new-vs-existing, topology, methodology/stack/devops/cloud, org-context round) rendering all
per-project artifacts idempotently via `scripts/render-block.sh` (tested: create /
update-preserving-hand-edits / prepend / idempotent re-run). Phase 2: `/harness-scan` —
brownfield detection: deterministic evidence collector (`scripts/scan-evidence.sh`, read-only,
bounded; tested against a synthetic repo) + `stack-detector` skill (usage-beats-listing
reasoning, org-context detection incl. private registries and implicit conventions, low
confidence → user question, never silent) + confirm-then-merge back through the same splicer.
Phase 3: `/harness-bootstrap` — recommender over `registry/recommendations.json` (profile→
plugin mappings with honest gaps, never-invent-a-plugin-name rule), opt-in multiSelect
installation (plugin / cli / mcp kinds, `pending-manual` fallback when the CLI is absent),
the 11-agent SDLC roster (architect, story-writer, implementers, db-engineer, unit/integration
testers, e2e planner/generator/healer, release-manager — narrow tools each), `.mcp.json`
merge template, and lockfile recording (installed/pending/declined). Phase 4: the memory
tiers — `wiki-ingest`/`wiki-query`/`wiki-lint` skills (Karpathy triad: synthesis-only pages
with provenance footers, contradiction blocks, index+log discipline), `memory-keeper`
conventions (append-only tier 2, typed causal links `solves`/`causes`/`builds-on`, promotion
rules), and `scripts/memory-log-commit.sh` (PostToolUse hook auto-logging commits/PRs/merges
to the daily log; tested — the escaped-quote JSON fix from this round also hardened
gate-check.sh against under-blocking). Phase 5: `/harness-goal` fully wired — supervisor
orchestration over the agent roster (grill → deep-dive → REQ ⛔ → story/tests → design →
worktree fan-out (db → backend ∥ frontend) → unit/integration → e2e trio → evidence ⛔ PR →
compose verify → ⛔ deploy → memory close-out), backed by `requirement-grill` skill,
`new-requirement.sh` (REQ scaffolding, YAML-safe escaping) and `worktree-task.sh` (isolated
task worktrees; refuses dirty removal) — both tested. Phase 6: `/harness-sync` — four-axis
drift detection (profile re-scan, recommendation diff vs. lockfile with declined-items
memory, template-hash drift via `template-hash.sh` [tested], memory health) → diff-first
report → confirmed refresh of generated blocks only, `syncs:` history in the lockfile.

Phase 7 (the buildable parts): `templates/workspace.yaml` (units, shared block, contracts
registry) wired into init; `scripts/contract-check.sh` — deterministic cross-unit impact
flagging when a provided contract changes (standalone + push/PR hook mode; tested incl. two
edge-case fixes); `/harness-export` + `scripts/export-agents.sh` — 11 agents compiled to
Copilot agent profiles / Cursor rules (idempotent; codex reads AGENTS.md natively), plus
**hooks export to Copilot**: `scripts/copilot-hook-adapter.sh` + `templates/copilot-hooks.json`
run the gate/org-validate/memory-log/contract hooks on Copilot's coding agent + CLI
(semantics translated: Claude exit-2 block → Copilot `permissionDecision` deny; tested).
Skills remain Claude-only; capability table in the export command stays honest.

**v1 build plan (Phases 0–6) complete; Phase 7 buildable parts done.** Remaining: federated
service graph + workspace-level goal loop (pending structural-memory bake-off), web UI
profile-builder, swarm backend, video/NAS ingestion — and hardening (jq-based hook parsing,
CI validation of registry names against live marketplaces, real-world dogfooding).

## A5 improvements over the literal spec

| A5 improvement | Implemented by |
|---|---|
| 1. Progressive-disclosure context injection (not feed-everything) | `plugins/se-harness/skills/context-injector/` + `scripts/inject-context.sh` (UserPromptSubmit hook) |
| 2. Refined requirements in `.harness/requirements/` (committed), not `.temp` | `templates/requirement.md` + `commands/harness-goal.md` step 3 |
| 3. Secrets split: committed profile vs gitignored env | `templates/profile.yaml`, `templates/env.harness.example`, `templates/gitignore.harness` |
| 4. Jira/XRay as system of record via MCP | `commands/harness-goal.md` step 4 |
| 5. HITL gates only at irreversible steps | `commands/harness-goal.md` gates (steps 3/7/9) + `scripts/gate-check.sh` (PreToolUse hook) |
| 6. Video/NAS ingestion deferred to v2 | encoded in `templates/profile.yaml` (`sources.deferred`) |
| 7. Org libraries as generation target (compose-first) + machine-checkable validation | `templates/AGENTS.md.tmpl` org section + `scripts/org-validate.sh` (PostToolUse hook) |
