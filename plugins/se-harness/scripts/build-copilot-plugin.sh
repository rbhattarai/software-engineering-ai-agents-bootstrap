# build-copilot-plugin.sh — generate the Copilot CLI plugin variant (plugins/se-harness-copilot)
# from the Claude-first se-harness plugin. B6 compiler pattern: shared source, thin per-platform
# converter, deterministic output, clean-before-regenerate. Commit the output — Copilot installs
# it from this repo via `copilot plugin install se-harness-copilot@<marketplace>`.
#
# Per docs/copilot/platform-notes.md:
#   agents  → NAME.agent.md (tools field dropped; carried as body guidance)
#   skills  → SKILL.md standard is shared; copied verbatim; PLUS each command is also emitted
#             as a skill directory (Copilot commands are skill-shaped — user-verified)
#   commands→ copied with ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ rewritten to tools/harness/ (repo-vendored)
#   hooks   → bundled hooks.json with plugin-root-relative ./scripts/ paths (user-verified:
#             plugin hooks.json paths resolve against the plugin root); repo-level
#             .github/hooks/ via templates/copilot-hooks.json remains supported too
#   mcp     → not bundled (guide covers MCP per-surface)
#
# usage: build-copilot-plugin.sh   (no args; paths derived from repo layout)
