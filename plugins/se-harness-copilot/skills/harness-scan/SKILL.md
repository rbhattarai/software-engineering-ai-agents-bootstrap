# /harness-scan — brownfield detection & profile merge

Detect what this codebase actually uses and fold it into the harness. Re-runnable anytime
(after big refactors, dependency migrations, or org-convention changes). Read-only until the
user confirms the proposal.

## Step 0 — Guard
`.harness/profile.yaml` must exist — if not, tell the user to run `/harness-init` first and stop.

## Step 1 — Collect evidence
Run the deterministic collector (read-only, bounded output):
```
bash tools/harness/scan-evidence.sh ${ARGUMENTS:-.}
```
If a code-graph MCP server is available (CodeGraph / codebase-memory-mcp), also index and pull
its architecture summary — richer structure, but the scan MUST work without it.

## Step 2 — Detect (stack-detector skill)
Reason over the evidence per the **stack-detector** skill: usage beats listing; version-aware;
app vs tooling; cloud from artifacts; per-unit stacks when topology markers exist. Follow up
with targeted file reads where the evidence is ambiguous — do not skip the verification greps.

Produce the proposal table (field | proposed value | evidence | confidence) covering:
`project.topology` (+ units if mono-repo), `stack.*`, `devops.*`, `cloud`, and the full
`org:` section (internal libraries, preferred libraries, conventions — explicit from configs
AND implicit inferred from code).

## Step 3 — Confirm with the user
- **High-confidence rows**: present the table, bulk-confirm.
- **Low-confidence rows and inconsistencies** (e.g. both `moment` and `dayjs` in use): ask
  one at a time via AskUserQuestion — the user decides what the standard is. Never write a
  low-confidence claim or an invented rule into the profile silently.
- Invite additions the scan can't see (unwritten team rules, internal libs not yet imported).

## Step 4 — Merge (only after confirmation)
1. **`.harness/profile.yaml`** — update detected keys. Existing user-entered values win on
   conflict unless the user explicitly approved the override in Step 3.
2. **`.harness/org-rules.txt`** — regenerate from the confirmed `org.preferred_libraries`
   pairs (`banned:<never>:use <use> (<reason>)`).
3. **AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md** — re-render the template inner blocks from the updated profile and
   splice via `bash tools/harness/render-block.sh <target> <block-file>`
   (never edit these files directly).
4. **`.harness/agentstack.lock`** — set `updated` timestamp and append a `scans:` entry
   (date + one-line summary of what changed).

## Step 5 — Report
Summarize as a before → after diff of the profile (only changed keys). Flag anything deferred
(low-confidence rows the user skipped) at the end so they're findable next run. Suggest
follow-ups: `wiki-ingest` for any conventions URL; Phase 3 bootstrap to install stack-matched
plugins for newly detected tech.
